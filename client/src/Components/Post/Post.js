                    <p>Monica Kakadelas Sattley has 3 children, ages 5, 3, and 1. She stays at home with the kiddos and works from home as a Rodan+Fields consultant. She is one of those people that you just love to be around. She makes you laugh, makes you feel better, and makes you a better person just by being who she is...and she is one magnificent hard-working momma! Here are some of her words: How has becoming a mom changed you? "So many ways!!! I think it has made me more sensitive to things going on around me. I always loved kids and was a Kindergarten teacher for five years but I didn't really understand the deep love that parents have for their children until I had my own." What's a 'go-to' when days get tough? "I usually have a hard time when I spend too much time inside so going outside for a walk with the kids, going to the park or going out for an errand helps me feel better. I've learned it's important to be flexible with kids and if things aren't going well that day it's okay to change plans last minute and make a new plan that will work better." Share a healthy recipe, ritual that you do, or exercise that you love. "I wish I cooked more but one thing that I love to make is pasta salad. It's easy and you can make it with any veggies that you have and it keeps for a couple days in the frig. Here is a recipe that I like for a Mediterranean Pasta Salad." ¼ cup good quality extra virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons chopped garlic (3-4 medium cloves) 2 tablespoons fresh oregano 1 teaspoon Kosher salt ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper ¼ cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (about one large lemon) 12 ounces dry Ditalini (or your favorite pasta) Zest from one lemon ½ cup pitted Kalamata olives sliced in half ½ cup grape tomatoes cut in half 1 tablespoon fresh mint, leaves rolled and sliced (chiffonade) 2 tablespoons fresh basil, leaves rolled and sliced (chiffonade) ½ cup red onions chopped 1 cup diced green bell pepper (about one medium pepper) 1 14-ounce can artichoke hearts drained, stems left on and quartered the long way 8 ounces crumbled feta cheese INSTRUCTIONS In a medium sauté pan over a low flame, add oil, garlic, oregano, salt and pepper and cook slowly for about 8 minutes or until the garlic just begins to brown. Remove from heat and add the lemon juice. Set this mixture aside. Start cooking the pasta per the box directions but cook just slightly under cooked. While the pasta is cooking, start preparing the remaining ingredients. When the pasta is just a little under done, remove to a colander and drain but do not rinse.Place cooked drained hot pasta in a large bowl and add the flavored oil and lemon juice mixture. Stir and let sit at room temperature for a few minutes.Add all other prepared ingredients except feta and stir. Refrigerate until chilled then stir in the feta and serve. — with Monica Kakadelas Sattley.</p>
